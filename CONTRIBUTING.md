## What is OpenStories?
OpenStories aims to gather success stories of Open advocates and practitioners to show that a successful Open career is possible.  Researchers see sharing their research openly as a risk. Many researchers are concerned the won’t get academic promotions, or their research will be scooped if they share it publicly. OpenStories will re-frame the conversation from risk to communicating that an open successful career is possible. The website will allow open success stories to be searchable by language, location, and research field so researchers can find another researcher’s story they identify with.
